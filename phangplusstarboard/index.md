On the day of today, Starboard has aquired authentication startup Phang. Phang is a powerful tool you can easily embed in your site to make logins easier.
This will allow further planning on an account system for Starboard Browser.

All Phang clients can continue to use their portal, and new clients are not allowed at this time as we do some tuning up.
