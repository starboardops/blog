Hi, 2q here, the creator of Starboard. We're making big changes to Starboard, and you are gonna love it.
First up:
Starboard 1.4 and up (until X) were powered on a framework called [Electron](https://electronjs.org). As you may have noticed,
browsing speeds can be a bit slow as Electron x Starboard is simply a browser inside built Chromium. Just without tabs.
<br>
We are developing a next-gen Starboard (aka Z or Liquid). This release is powered on Chromium, but we removed the bulls*it.
It may be released within 2-3 days (as of write date).
<br><br>

Second, X has been removed from the archives due to bugs. It is not recommended that you download Starboard Electron/Legacy due
to security issues & functionality flaws.
<br><br>

Third, Starboard Liquid **WILL** support ARM along with other arches. We will **NOT** be releasing Starboard Liquid for macOS or Linux, due
to capacity.
<br><br>

<br>
**Thanks,**<br>

*NOTE: Starboard Liquid, does, again, NOT have a current release date. You may expect it before April 2021.*
