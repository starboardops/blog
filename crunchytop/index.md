Written by @2qbruh on 01-24-2021

Hey everyone! 2q here. So, some interesting stuff has happened. [Crunchytop](https://github.com/crunchytop/crunchytop) has launched on GitHub.
This allows you to watch anime and read manga from an app.

Crunchytop is powered on Starboard Legacy (1.4-X2) and uses it to help with increased speeds.

To download the software, visit [this link](https://github.com/crunchytop/crunchytop/releases/latest). Note that it only supports Windows 10
and Ubuntu/Debian.
