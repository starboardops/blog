STATUS UPDATE - The ARM build scripts have been released for building on Apple Silicon, Windows, and Linux. They are bundled in 1.6.5.
Today marks a day in Starboard history. It wasn't easy, but we have now added support for ARM (RPi). Starboard can run on a Raspberry Pi with minimal latency
and 100% functionality compared to a 99% success rate on macOS, Windows, and non-ARM Linux such as Ubuntu or Debian.

The release of Starboard with ARM support (1.6.5 - also the last 1.6 release) will be released within the next few weeks. The new update requires the newest
Raspberry Pi OS download, and we recommend RPi 2+.
